  <th align=left>I started teaching 20 years ago, and in 2012 I went to Spain to train as an English language teacher. I love teaching students from Beginner to Advanced level. It's wonderful to see them improve their English and become more confident every day. I really like working with students from around the world -I often learn something interesting too! I studied American Studies and English at university and have a PGCE and CELTA.

When I'm not teaching, I'm drinking enormous amounts of coffee and/or singing and dancing with my twins.
</th>
<th align=left>I studied English Literature and Linguistics, and specialised in English Language Teaching and Applied Linguistics. I went on to develop my skills with a CELTA course, and a Diploma in TESOL in 2015. Over the last six years, I've been teaching the Cambridge exams, such as the First, Advanced and Proficiency exams, and the IELTS.

In my free time I enjoy watching documentaries, cycling, and exploring this beautiful city.</th>
<th align=left>My teaching journey started in 2013, and since then I have been lucky enough to work in several different countries, as well as here in the UK. Most recently, the majority of my teaching has been with adults, and this has included for general, business and academic purposes. I have also run a variety of workshops, debates and events, and always aim to help my students to contextualise and apply their learning to life outside of the classroom.

In my free time I enjoy gardening, playing with my dogs, and photography.</th><th align=left>joined Malvern House London in 2021, and I also have experience teaching in Vietnam and Australia. I have taught General English of all levels, IELTS and English for Academic purposes. I also ran clubs for pronunciation, grammar, conversation and the job application process in a previous role. I really enjoy meeting people from other countries and learning about their cultures and languages.

When I have a bit of free time, I enjoy spending time with my husband, my son and my naughty little cat, Biscuit</th>
